NvDCF:
  # [General]
  useUniqueID: 0    # Use 64-bit long Unique ID when assignining tracker ID. Default is [true]
  maxTargetsPerStream: 99 # Max number of targets to track per stream. Recommended to set >10. Note: this value should account for the targets being tracked in shadow mode as well. Max value depends on the GPU memory capacity

  # [Feature Extraction]
  useColorNames: 1     # Use ColorNames feature
  useHog: 0            # Use Histogram-of-Oriented-Gradient (HOG) feature
  useHighPrecisionFeature: 0   # Use high-precision in feature extraction. Default is [true]

  # [DCF]
  filterLr: 0.15 # learning rate for DCF filter in exponential moving average. Valid Range: [0.0, 1.0]
  filterChannelWeightsLr: 0.22 # learning rate for the channel weights among feature channels. Valid Range: [0.0, 1.0]
  gaussianSigma: 0.75 # Standard deviation for Gaussian for desired response when creating DCF filter [pixels]
  featureImgSizeLevel: 3 # Size of a feature image. Valid range: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, from the smallest to the largest
  SearchRegionPaddingScale: 1 # Search region size. Determines how large the search region should be scaled from the target bbox.  Valid range: {1, 2, 3}, from the smallest to the largest

  # [MOT] [False Alarm Handling]
  maxShadowTrackingAge: 30  # Max length of shadow tracking (the shadow tracking age is incremented when (1) there's detector input yet no match or (2) tracker confidence is lower than minTrackerConfidence). Once reached, the tracker will be terminated.
  probationAge: 3           # Once the tracker age (incremented at every frame) reaches this, the tracker is considered to be valid
  earlyTerminationAge: 1    # Early termination age (in terms of shadow tracking age) during the probation period. If reached during the probation period, the tracker will be terminated prematurely.

  # [Tracker Creation Policy] [Target Candidacy]
  minDetectorConfidence: -1  # If the confidence of a detector bbox is lower than this, then it won't be considered for tracking
  minTrackerConfidence: 0.7  # If the confidence of an object tracker is lower than this on the fly, then it will be tracked in shadow mode. Valid Range: [0.0, 1.0]
  minTargetBboxSize: 10      # If the width or height of the bbox size gets smaller than this threshold, the target will be terminated.
  minDetectorBboxVisibilityTobeTracked: 0.0  # If the detector-provided bbox's visibility (i.e., IOU with image) is lower than this, it won't be considered.
  minVisibiilty4Tracking: 0.0  # If the visibility of the tracked object (i.e., IOU with image) is lower than this, it will be terminated immediately, assuming it is going out of scene.

  # [Tracker Termination Policy]
  targetDuplicateRunInterval: 5 # The interval in which the duplicate target detection removal is carried out. A Negative value indicates indefinite interval. Unit: [frames]
  minIou4TargetDuplicate: 0.9 # If the IOU of two target bboxes are higher than this, the newer target tracker will be terminated.

  # [Data Association] Matching method
  useGlobalMatching: 0   # If true, enable a global matching algorithm (i.e., Hungarian method). Otherwise, a greedy algorithm wll be used.
